            <h2>How We Do It</h2>

            <img id="graphic-image" src="./assets/images/graphic.png" alt="a graphic of a carbon cycle" />
            <p>Understanding and optimizing the carbon cycle is how we can make agriculture a critical tool for healing
                the planet.

                Healthy soil creates healthy crops, and ultimately healthy people. It filters the water we drink, and
                supports stronger and more nutrient dense plant life that filters our air and permanently sequesters
                carbon back into the soil. Once carbon is back in the soil it changes from a threat to a benefit. Our
                cutting edge processes help build and heal the soil in years instead of centuries if it was left up to
                nature to do it alone.

                This isn’t just about soil - it’s about empowering our stewards of the land: America’s farmers. By
                adopting regenerative agriculture practices powered by biochar, they’re improving yields, reducing
                costs,and creating new revenue streams through soil carbon credits.
                Join us as we embark on a transformative journey, one that promises not only to redefine the landscape
                of American agriculture but to pioneer a path towards a sustainable future for our planet
                Let’s look at the steps of this remarkable process in more detail -

                <h3>Dead Trees:</h3>
                <p>
                    Since 1997, a host of native beetle species has chewed through more than 40 million acres of Western
                    forests, according to aerial surveys by the U.S. Forest Service. 2 million acres in Utah alone.
                    by harnessing the untapped potential of what nature provides – the vast expanses of deadfall, a
                    result of necessary forest management and natural cycles, yet a contributing factor to the wildfire
                    crisis that ravage our landscapes and resources.
                    Through the innovative utilization of deadfall for the creation of biochar, AgriCarbon is not merely
                    mitigating the risks of extreme wildfires but is actively producing a climate-positive resource that
                    stands as a beacon of hope in our battle against climate change. This process is helping
                    revitalizing our soils, and most importantly, preventing the release of greenhouse gases and
                    sequestering carbon in a way that helps nature heal itself.

                <h3>Boichar:</h3>
                <p>
                    Biochar is a valuable soil amendment that can significantly improve soil health and productivity.
                    Its ability to enhance water and nutrient retention, improve soil structure, and support microbial
                    activity makes it a promising tool for sustainable agriculture.
                    Biochar is created through a process called pyrolysis. This involves heating biomass (such as wood,
                    agricultural waste, or manure) in the absence of oxygen. This process essentially "cooks" the
                    organic elements out of biomass at high temperatures, converting it into a charcoal-like substance,
                    so what is left is mostly pure carbon.. Well produced biochar has tremendous surface area full of
                    channels and tubes that can absorb water, hold nutrients in the soil, and provide the perfect spaces
                    for microbiota to thrive.
                </p>
                <p>Here's a breakdown of the benefits biochar provides to soil:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Improved Water Retention:</strong> Biochar's porous structure acts like a sponge,
                        helping to hold onto water and release it slowly to plants. This is especially beneficial in
                        drought-prone areas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enhanced Nutrient Retention:</strong> Biochar can attract and hold onto essential plant
                        nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, preventing them from leaching away.</li>
                    <li><strong>Increased Soil Fertility:</strong> Biochar provides a habitat for beneficial soil
                        microorganisms, such as fungi and bacteria. These microbes play a crucial role in breaking down
                        organic matter and making nutrients available to plants.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improved Soil Structure:</strong> Biochar can help to loosen compacted soils, improving
                        aeration and drainage. This allows for better root growth and overall plant health.</li>
                    <li><strong>Carbon Sequestration:</strong> By converting biomass into a stable form of carbon,
                        biochar helps to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, mitigating climate change.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Fertilizer:</h3>
                <p>
                    AgriCarbon supercharges biochar by infusing it with an organic liquid fertilizer. Combined with our
                    organic liquid fertilizers, it accelerates soil regeneration, achieving in just a few years what
                    would naturally take centuries. Our process starts with doing detailed testing on each individual
                    area of land, then based on the
                    results we custom blend a biochar and organic fertilizer blend designed to treat the specific
                    nutrition deficiencies and challenges that specific plot has. This type of comprehensive soil health
                    programs we work with farmers to repair soil structure,
                    replenish nutrients and restore carbon with our organic fertilizer. Through soil analysis and
                    customized organic soil prescriptions we reduce dependency on synthetic fertilizers and pesticides.
                    This reduces farming costs and increases yields, and opens up new revenue streams through the
                    principles of regenerative agriculture and carbon capture.

                <p>
                    Providing soil with the necessary nutrition sets off a chain reaction of positive benefits.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Increased Organic Matter:</strong> The addition of nutrients stimulates the activity of
                        beneficial soil organisms like bacteria and fungi. These organisms break down organic matter,
                        creating nutrient-rich humus.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improved Water Retention:</strong> Healthy soil with good organic matter content holds
                        onto water more effectively, reducing water runoff and drought stress for plants.</li>
                    <li><strong>Better Drainage:</strong> Improved soil structure allows for better water infiltration
                        and drainage, preventing waterlogging and promoting healthy root growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reduced Environmental Impact:</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Reduced Fertilizer Use:</strong> When soil is naturally fertile, the need for
                            synthetic fertilizers decreases, minimizing pollution of waterways.</li>
                        <li><strong>Increased Carbon Sequestration:</strong> Healthy soils with high organic matter
                            content act as carbon sinks, helping to mitigate climate change.</li>

                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Nutrient Density:</strong> Fruits, vegetables, and grains grown in healthy soil tend

                <p>
                    Healthy soil with high levels of organic carbon matter has several positive impacts on water
                    filtration and conservation:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Improved Water Infiltration:</strong> Organic matter acts like a sponge, increasing the
                        soil's ability to absorb and hold water. This reduces surface runoff, minimizes soil erosion,
                        and allows water to slowly percolate into the ground, replenishing groundwater supplies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enhanced Water Filtration:</strong> As water moves through the soil, organic matter acts
                        as a natural filter. It helps trap pollutants like pesticides, fertilizers, and heavy metals,
                        preventing them from contaminating groundwater and surface water bodies. Beneficial soil
                        microorganisms also break down some pollutants.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reduced Water Loss:</strong> Healthy soil with high organic matter content has better
                        water-holding capacity. This reduces the need for excessive irrigation, conserving water
                        resources, especially in arid and semi-arid regions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improved Water Quality:</strong> By filtering pollutants, healthy soil helps maintain
                        cleaner water sources for drinking, agriculture, and ecosystems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reduced Flood Risk:</strong> Increased water infiltration due to high organic matter
                        content helps reduce the risk of flooding by allowing more water to soak into the ground instead
                        of accumulating on the surface.</li>

                <h3>Carbon Returned:</h3>
                <p>
                    Coupling soil remediation with regenerative practices such as no till, cover cropping and rotational
                    grazing work together to increase farming yields and pull carbon out of the atmosphere. Robust soil
                    allows plants to extend root systems deep into the ground, storing the sequestered carbon in the
                    soil, and additional revenue sources are opened to farmers and ranchers through carbon markets.

                    According to the website theclimateTrust.org, “The top meter of grassland soils store around 49
                    tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents per acre”. Soil Carbon Capture is one of the few initiatives
                    that will efficiently drawdown the legacy carbon load, bridging the gap between continued fossil
                    fuel usage and climate change. Employing innovative approaches allow us to turn healing the planet
                    into fiscally beneficial solutions for farmers and ranchers.

            <h2>Our Farmers and Communities</h2>
            <p>
                Our journey at AgriCarbon is driven by the belief that the fertility of our soils is directly linked to
                the prosperity of our farmers and the health of our communities. We are helping farmers weaponize their
                fields against climate change and turn challenges into fiscally responsible solutions.
                The benefits extend far beyond the farm. Rural economies thrive as biochar production, organic
                fertilizers and regenerative farming create new jobs. Communities become more resilient, mitigating the
                risks of wildfires and droughts while building healthy nutrient rich soils, all while helping to
                conserve water, clean our air, and sequester carbon.
                We help farmers and growers transition to practices that restore soil, improve food security, and
                mitigate climate change - all while ensuring economic growth.
                 At AgriCarbon, we’re transforming environmental challenges into sustainable opportunities.
